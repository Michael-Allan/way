Moral uncertainty: the ground of right

    + Claim the fact of moral dissensus.
        : see notebook:2021-10-17a,26c,27b,29a
    - Aware of this moral dissensus, I am in a state of moral uncertainty.
    - I have reason to suspect that without my knowledge one or more norms are morally binding on me.
    - Therefore I am duty bound to make a best effort at learning what those norms are.
        : cf. `^^- Absent such an end, I am rationally bound to go in search of it` @
          http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec : Another instance
          of a binding default norm triggered by oneâ€™s awareness of normative ignorance.

        principle: In suspecting that one is morally bound by a norm of which one is ignorant, one is
          morally bound to a best effort at learning what that norm is and whether indeed it binds.

            + Consider quoting or otherwise referring (for comparison) to Spinozaâ€™s claim
              that moral norms are artifacts of our ignorance, our incompleteness.
                : see `^^Schneewind.+1998.+The invention of autonomy` @ bibliography.brec : p. 217.2

    - On this principle, I must take M as my end.
        : cf. `I must take W as my end\.$` @
          http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec :
          How M relates to W is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.

        M. Knowledge of what norms morally bind me.

            + Clarify (at least in a comment) that the premise of M alone, or any bounden end at all,
              suffices to infer the rights with which the ethic concludes.
    - Only a stable consensus can validate knowledge.

        C. A stable consensus on what norms morally bind one.

        + Warrant this claim.
            : join @ `^^- Only.consensus can validate knowledge` @
              http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec
            - Warrant by principle and/or argument.
        - C refers exclusively to norms not premised on moral uncertainty.
            / A consensus on the present ethic, for example, would not suffice.

    - A stable consensus, and thereby knowledge, requires a sustained quorum.

        H. The rational macrocommunity of humankind extant through C to M.

            + Define the â€˜rational macrocommunity of humankindâ€™.
                : join @ `^^H\. ` @ http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec

    + Address the objection that, for any end E, our existence is a mere *premise*
      as opposed to a *necessary condition*.
        : cf. @ ._/moral_uncertainty_boneyard.brec
        - That objection (which I only imagine) is off the mark: H refers to our ongoing existence
          given that *already* we exist.
        - Duty binds me to seek moral certainty, but that moral certainty cannot just be my own,
          as knowledge cannot just be my own.
            : see `^^- Only a stable consensus can validate knowledge`
            : cf. notebook:2021-9-27c,d,e
            - Always knowledge (for us) depends on consensus and therefore exists
              beyond any single one of us.
            + Ensure the principle that warrants M is stated in terms of knowledge,
              e.g a duty to attain knowledge of the norm and whether it binds.
                : see `^^principle:.+suspecting.+ one is morally bound by a norm`
        + Nothing in the principle that warrants M entitles one (in a state of moral uncertainty)
          to presuppose what an unknown norm consists in, or to whom (or what) it is owed,
          and then excuse oneself from duty on that basis.
            : re `principle that warrants M` see `^^principle:.+suspecting.+ one is morally bound`
            / The norm itself might very well entail a concern for our ongoing existence.
        + Ensure to state that M must serve an end of absolute worth (say N).
            / Regardless of whether this is useful in countering the objection or otherwise warranting H.
            - Whether N and X would be identical, or [otherwise] how they would relate [to each other],
              is unknown to us.

    âˆ´ Duty binds me to take M as my end, and with it C and H.
