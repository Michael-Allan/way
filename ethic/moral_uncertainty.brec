Moral uncertainty

    + Claim the fact of moral dissensus.
        : see notebook:2021-10-17a,26c,27b,29a
    - Aware of this moral dissensus, I am in a state of moral uncertainty.
    - I have reason to suspect that without my knowledge one or more norms are morally binding on me.
    - Therefore I am duty bound to make a best effort at learning what those norms are.
        : cf. `^^- Absent such an end, I am rationally bound to go in search of it` @
          http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_deficit_of_reason.brec : Another instance
          of a binding default norm triggered by oneâ€™s awareness of normative ignorance.

        principle: In suspecting that one is morally bound by a norm of which one is ignorant, one is
          morally bound to a best effort at learning what that norm is and whether indeed it binds.

            + Consider quoting or otherwise referring (for comparison) to Spinozaâ€™s claim
              that moral norms are artifacts of our ignorance, our incompleteness.
                : see `^^Schneewind.+1998.+The invention of autonomy` @ bibliography.brec : p. 217.2

    - On this principle, I must take M as my end.
        : cf. `I must take W as my end\.$` @
          http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_deficit_of_reason.brec :
          How M relates to W is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.

        M. Knowledge of what norms morally bind me.

    - Only a consensus could validate such knowledge.

        C. A stable consensus on what norms morally bind one.

        - C refers exclusively to norms not premised on moral uncertainty.
            / A consensus on the present ethic, for example, would not suffice.

    - A consensus requires a quorum in advance of it.

        H. The rational nature of humankind extant through to C.

    + Address the objection that our existence is a mere premise of C.
        : see notebook:2021-9-27c,d,e
        - A critical objection to H is that our existence is a *premise* for any end E,
          as opposed to a *necessary condition*.
        - This I will defeat by what the macrocosmic fit suggests.
            : see notebook:2021-10-2f,g
            - It would be unreasonable to assume that our moral obligations (including M)
              are owed to each other or each other alone.  We have reason to suspect
                a) a positive obligation for action on my part
                    !! How could I act after I am dead?
                b) in regard to (or owed to) someone or something else.
            - In sum, the macrocosmic fit gives a (default) reason for us to exist
              in the first place.
            - So M cannot be assumed as relative to us; the criticâ€™s implication that M
              merely serves *us* is shown to be unwarranted.
        !! How can H possibly hold against this objection?  How can the principle that grounds C
          possibly warrant H beyond my life span?
            | A postulate might be warranted by the macrocosmic fit.
            | Practical reason unravels should our extinction be foretold.
    âˆ´ I have reason to take M as my end, and with it C and H.
