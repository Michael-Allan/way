Moral uncertainty: the ground of right

    + Claim the fact of moral dissensus.
        : see notebook:2021-10-17a,26c,27b,29a
    - Aware of this moral dissensus, I am in a state of moral uncertainty.
    - I have reason to suspect that without my knowledge one or more norms are morally binding on me.
    - Therefore I am duty bound to make a best effort at learning what those norms are.
        : cf. `^^- Absent such an end, I am rationally bound to go in search of it` @
          http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec : Another instance
          of a binding default norm triggered by one’s awareness of normative ignorance.

        principle: Having reason to suspect that one is morally bound by a norm without one’s knowledge,
          one is morally bound to seek knowledge of that norm and whether indeed it binds.

            + Consider quoting or otherwise referring (for comparison) to Spinoza’s claim
              that moral norms are artifacts of our ignorance, our incompleteness.
                : see `^^Schneewind.+1998.+The invention of autonomy` @ bibliography.brec : p. 217.2
    - On this principle, I must take M as my end.
        : cf. `I must take W as my end\.$` @
          http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec :
          How M relates to W is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.

        M. Knowledge of what norms morally bind me.

            + Clarify (at least in a comment) that the premise of M alone, or any bounden end at all,
              suffices to infer the rights with which the ethic concludes.
            + Ensure to state (somewhere) that M must serve an end of absolute worth, else serve W.
                - Our moral obligations cannot run afoul of reason.
    - Only a stable consensus can validate knowledge on a topic that lies open to controversy.
        : re `open to controversy` see `^^\+ Claim the fact of moral dissensus`

        C. A stable consensus on what norms morally bind one.

        + Warrant this claim.

              http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec
            - Warrant by principle and/or argument.
        - C refers exclusively to norms not premised on moral uncertainty.
            / A consensus on the present ethic, for example, would not suffice.
    - A stable consensus requires a sustained quorum.

        H. The rational macrocommunity of humankind extant through C to M.

            + Define the ‘rational macrocommunity of humankind’.
                : join @ `^^H\. ` @ http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec
    - In binding me to an end (M) that is necessarily collective (C), duty has bound me
      to the interim maintenance (H) of the collective itself.
    - Short of these ends, no alternatives exist within moral bounds.
        : cf. `no alternatives exist within the bounds of reason\.$` @
          http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec
        - M is unlikely to be attained in my own time.  But even if I judged it unattainable,
          still duty would bind my will to it, and thereby to C and H.
        - Nothing in the principle that warrants M entitles me (in a state of moral uncertainty)
          to presuppose what an unknown norm consists in, or to whom (or what) it is owed,
          and then excuse myself from duty’s entailments on that basis.
            : re `principle that warrants M` see `^^principle: Having reason to suspect.+one is.+bound`
        - The unknown norm *itself* might well entail a concern for what lies beyond the span of my life.
    ∴ I must take M as my end, and with it C and H.
