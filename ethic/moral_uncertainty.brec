Moral uncertainty

    - Moral uncertainty is not knowing exactly what norms are morally binding on one.
        - If asked, one would be unable to give an account of them.
    - Moral uncertainty is common, rarely acknowledged and rarely regarded as a problem.
        - Equally common are uncertainties about [two other elusive â€¦] the purpose and meaning of life.
            / Why are we here?  What does it all mean?
        - These two are frequently acknowledged, however, and frequently regarded as a problem.
    - Yet all three â€¦ connected â€¦
        - â€¦ purpose â€¦ meaning â€¦ undermine â€¦ sense of value, of worth
        - And we know that conception of value, of the good, is central to normative ethics.
        - Kant famously said â€¦
            + Paraphrase in brief, then quote.

    - All three â€¦ connected â€¦ in something else â€¦ unknown {before 1905 | to Kantâ€™s age}
        : privately re `1905` see `^^\+ Quote Ensteinâ€™s 1905 paper\.$` : Here refer to that quote.
        + Here summarizing the premise without stating the â€˜something elseâ€™.
        + Here too speaking of default ethic, and default in regard to the other two uncertainties.
        + Then bringing in the other thing common among them (sense of value)
          and suggesting what this (default) ethic etc. implies about that.
            - A thing left open like the questions, and hanging like the answers, a thing at stake?
