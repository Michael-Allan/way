Eternity by way of reason

    aim
        - We pursue HR as a final end.

            HR. Ends H and R in conjunction.

            H. Humanity extant through all reasonable ends.
                - For any reasonable end E that would obtain at time tE,
                  humanity continues to exist through tE.
                - Reasonable ends are those we have reason to value.
                    - Reason is the determinant of value.

            R. Full realization of our capacity for reason.

    warrant
        - HR has incomparable value.
        - No reasonable end E has greater value than HR.
            âˆµ The value of HR includes the value of E.
                âˆµ HR includes E.
                    âˆµ E is a reasonable end.
                    âˆµ All reasonable ends are included in HR.
            âˆµ HR excludes all ends of net negative value.
                âˆµ HR includes only reasonable ends.
                âˆµ No reasonable end has absolute negative value except where it is
                  a necessary condition to a further end of (net) positive value.

    warrant for R
        a) R is a condition of the supreme value that warrants HR.
            âˆµ The value of HR depends on the extent of progress toward R.
                âˆµ Reason is the determinant of the reasonable ends of H,
                  on which the value of HR is based.

                    : see `^^warrant$`
        b) R is a prudent means toward H.
            âˆµ The adoption of ends such as H depends on progress toward R.
