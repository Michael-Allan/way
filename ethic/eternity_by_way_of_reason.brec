Eternity by way of reason

    - This file describes a final end in the full realization of humanity â€” in reason consummate,
      and time on-going â€” and argues for its incomparable value.

        - HR as a final end.

            HR. The conjunction of ends H and R.
            H. Humanity extant through all reasonable ends.
                - For any reasonable end E that would obtain at time tE,
                  humanity continues to exist through tE.
                - Reasonable ends are those we have reason to value.
                    : see `^^evaluation of ends$`
            R. Full exercise of our capacity for reason.

        humanity
            - Our rational nature.
        evaluation of ends
            - The evaluator is reason.
            - Any specific theory of value or other evaluative criterion is itself subject
              to reasoned evaluation: we employ it only so far as we have reason to value
              its employment based on logic, trial and error, and deliberation.

        / Why pursue HR?
        - HR has incomparable value.
        - No reasonable end E has greater value than HR.

                  vHR â‰¥ vE

            âˆµ vHR is an aggregate that includes vE.
                âˆµ HR includes E.
                    âˆµ E is a reasonable end.
                    âˆµ All reasonable ends are included in HR.
            âˆµ HR excludes all ends of net negative value.
                / The aggregate worth of other included ends cannot be less than zero.
                âˆµ HR includes only reasonable ends.
                âˆµ No reasonable end N has negative value except where it conditions a further end P
                  of positive value, such that together they have net positive value.

                          vN + vP > 0

                    + Expand to account for multiple N per P.
                        / Viz. multiple conditioning ends of negative value per conditioned end.
        importance of R
            / Why HR, not H alone?
            - R is a limiting condition of the aggregate value that warrants HR, and thereby warrants H.
                : re `aggregate value that warrants HR` see `^^ warrant$`
            - How far we exercise our capacity for reason (RÂ°, the degree of R)
              affects the aggregate value in three ways.
                i. RÂ° determines how reasonable are the ends of H (component ends), which in turn
                  determines what they contribute to the aggregate value.
                    : see `^^- Reasonable ends are those we have reason to value\.$`
                    - Lapses here will tend to lessen the aggregate value of HR
                      by lessening the value of its component ends.
                ii. RÂ° determines the firmness of will and fitness of means put to each component end.
                    âˆµ The willing of ends and the choosing of means are functions of practical reason.
                    - Lapses here will tend to undermine the aggregate value of HR
                      by threatening the attainment of one or more component ends.
                iii. RÂ° determines the firmness of will and fitness of means put to avoiding extinction.
                    : re `avoiding extinction` see `Humanity extant` @ `^^HR\.$` @ `^^ aim$`
                    : re `avoiding extinction` see ../diaspora/facing_existential_hazard.brec
                    âˆµ The willing of ends and the choosing of means are functions of practical reason.
                    - Lapses here will pose a threat to the aggregate value of HR by risking a premature
                      extinction that would cut short the attainment of its component ends.
