Humanity in full

    - This file describes a final end in the full realization of humanity — in reason consummate,
      and achievement complete — and argues for its pursuit on the ground of prior duty.


    ━━━━━
     Aim ─ the full realization of humanity
    ─────
        - A final end in HR.

            HR. The first conjunction of ends H and R.
                : re `first conjunction` see `^^- If ever we judge from.+R that no emanant end remains`
                - HR comprises H, R and HR proper.
            H. Humanity extant through all actual and reasonable final ends.
                - For any actual and reasonable final end E that would obtain at time tE,
                  humanity continues to exist through tE.
                : re `actual` see `^^H must address ends that are actual$` @ `^^ Notes?$`
            R. Full exercise of our capacity for reason.
                - Here ‘full’ means the maximum that realistically we could sustain at a given time.

        - If ever we judge from the high vantage of R that no emanant end remains to be achieved,
          then we can infer that HR has been achieved.
            - We might reasonably risk extinction then, but not before.
            / And if instead we come to judge that our rational nature (or capacity for reason)
              is a final end in its own right, as did Kant, then we will seek to expand it
              and prolong its exercise indefinitely, and so defy extinction.
                : re `as did Kant` see `^^Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ bibliography.brec :
                  ‘… *a rational nature [e.g. humanity] exists as an end in itself*’,
                  which involves a concern not only ‘with the *preservation*’, but also
                  ‘the *advancement* of this end.’  4:429, 430, italics in original
                / This we would pursue as an emanant end — a separate variant of the existential end R,
                  lying in parallel with it, which we might call ‘R-ongoing’.
        HR proper
            - HR is more than the sum of H and R.
                : see `HR comprises H, R and HR proper` @ `^^HR\.`
            - HR proper is what HR adds to that sum.
                : e.g. `^^HR\. The (first conjunction)`
        existential end
            - One of H, R or HR.
        emanant end
            - An actual, reasonable and final end that is not an existential end.
        actual end
            - An end that is willed.

            / Showing whether an end is reasonable.
            - An end is reasonable that:
                a) is realistic,
                    : see `^^realistic ends$`
                b) is not excluded on account of its relation to other ends, and
                    : see `^^interrelated ends$`
                c) we have reason to value, whether in its own right, or as a condition
                   of a further end which itself is reasonable.
                    : see `^^evaluation of ends$`
            - Justification proceeds in milieux where lines of thought, claims and counter-claims,
              are defeasible through public exposure.
            realistic ends
                - An end is realistic only if it would obtain within the bounds of humanity.
                    / What would obtain outside the bounds of humanity can be an effect (whether natural
                      or supernatural) of a realistic end, but it cannot be a realistic end in itself.
                    - To expect its attainment with no witness to the fact would be unrealistic.
            interrelated ends
                - Where the viability or value of an end is relative to the presence of another end,
                  the whole network of interrelated ends is evaluated over all its combinations.
                    - One combination at most is chosen.
                    - Its ends alone are reasonable.
            evaluation of ends
                - Evaluation is based on reason.
                    / This is not to imply that the source of value is reason, only to stipulate
                      that reason be the arbiter and ultimate judge of its estimation.
                - Theories of value and evaluative practices are themselves subject to
                  reasoned evaluation: we employ them only where we have reason to value them,
                  in preference to alternatives, based on logic, trial and error, and deliberation.

     Warrant ─ an argument for pursuing HR on the ground of prior duty
    ─────────
        HR proper is apodictic
            ∵ It is reasonable to risk the extinction of that which serves no reasonable end.
                : re `serves no reasonable end` see `^^- If.+we judge.+that no emanant end remains`
            / HR proper concerns nothing else.
        H is apodictic
            ∵ Humanity extant is already a necessary condition of any reasonable end.
                / Making it explicit (as end H) serves only to clarify the definition of HR proper.
                ∵ A reasonable end is necessarily realistic.
                    : see `is realistic` @ `^^- An end is reasonable that:$`
                ∵ To be realistic requires that the end would obtain within the bounds of humanity.
                    : re `To be realistic.+(obtain.+humanity)` see head @ `^^realistic ends$`

     Note

        H must address ends that are actual
            - Else H would no longer be apodictic.
                : see `^^H is apodictic$`
                ∵ It would require humanity to exist through ends that nobody wills, a requirement
                  that could hardly be apodictic on pragmatic and deontic grounds.
