Humanity in full

    - This file describes a final end in the full realization of humanity — in reason consummate,
      and achievement complete — and offers pragmatic, deontic and telic grounds for its pursuit.


    ━━━━━
     Aim ─ the full realization of humanity
    ─────
        - A final end in HR.

            HR. The first conjunction of ends H and R.
                : re `first conjunction` see `^^- If ever we judge from.+R that no component end remains`
                - HR comprises H, R and HR proper.
            H. Humanity extant through all actual and reasonable ends.
                - For any actual and reasonable end E that would obtain at time tE,
                  humanity continues to exist through tE.
                : re `actual` see `^^H must address ends that are actual$` @ `^^ Notes?$`
            R. Full exercise of our capacity for reason.
                - Here ‘full’ means the maximum that realistically we could sustain at a given time.

        - If ever we judge from the high vantage of R that no component end remains to be achieved,
          then we can infer that all principal ends have been achieved.
            - We might reasonably risk extinction then, but not before.
            / And if instead we come to judge that our rational nature (or capacity for reason)
              should be a final end in its own right, as did Kant, then we will seek to expand it
              and prolong its exercise indefinitely, and so defy extinction.
                : re `as did Kant` see `^^Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ bibliography.brec :
                  ‘… a rational nature [e.g. humanity] exists as an end in itself.’  4:429
                / Then H would include as a component end — in parallel with the principal end R —
                  a separate variant of R, which we might call ‘R-ongoing’.
        actual end
            - An end that is willed.
        principal end
            - One of H, R or HR.
        component end
            - An actual and reasonable end that is not a principal end.
        HR proper
            - HR is more than the sum of H and R.
                : see `HR comprises H, R and HR proper` @ `^^HR\.`
            - HR proper is what HR adds to that sum.

         ends justification
        ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
            / Showing whether an end is reasonable.
            - An end is reasonable that:
                a) is realistic,
                    : see `^^realistic ends$`
                b) is not excluded on account of its relation to other ends, and
                    : see `^^interrelated ends$`
                c) we have reason to value, whether in its own right, or as a condition
                   of a further end which itself is reasonable.
                    : see `^^evaluation of ends$`
            - Justification proceeds in milieux where lines of thought, claims and counter-claims,
              are defeasible through public exposure.
            realistic ends
                - An end is realistic only if it would obtain within the bounds of humanity.
                    / What would obtain outside the bounds of humanity can be an effect (whether natural
                      or supernatural) of a realistic end, but it cannot be a realistic end in itself.
                    - To expect its attainment with no witness to the fact would be unrealistic.
            interrelated ends
                - Where the viability or value of an end is relative to the presence of another end,
                  the whole network of interrelated ends is evaluated over all its combinations.
                    - One combination at most is chosen.
                    - Its ends alone are reasonable.
            evaluation of ends
                - Evaluation is based on reason.
                    / This is not to imply that the source of value is reason, only to stipulate
                      that reason be the arbiter and ultimate judge of its estimation.
                - Theories of value and evaluative practices are themselves subject to
                  reasoned evaluation: we employ them only where we have reason to value them,
                  in preference to alternatives, based on logic, trial and error, and deliberation.

     Pragmatic warrant ─ an argument for pursuing HR on the ground of prudence
    ───────────────────
        HR proper is apodictic
            ∵ It is reasonable to risk the extinction of that which serves no reasonable end.
                : re `serves no reasonable end` see `^^- If.+we judge.+that no component end remains`
            / HR proper concerns nothing else.
        H is apodictic
            ∵ Humanity extant is already a necessary condition of any reasonable end.
                / Making it explicit (as end H) serves only to clarify the definition of HR proper.
                ∵ A reasonable end is necessarily realistic.
                    : see `is realistic` @ `^^- An end is reasonable that:$`
                ∵ To be realistic requires that the end would obtain within the bounds of humanity.
                    : re `To be realistic.+(obtain.+humanity)` see head @ `^^realistic ends$`
            : N.B. `^^H must address ends that are actual$` @ `^^ Notes?$`
        R is prudent, anything short of it posing a threat to H
            ∵ °R determines the prevalence of will and fitness of means brought to bear on H.
                ∵ Our choices of ends willed and of means brought to bear on them
                  are functions of practical reason.
            ∵ H has yet to be achieved.
                ∵ We have ends at present which generally are thought to be reasonable.

     Telic warrant ─ an argument for pursuing HR on the ground of consequential value
    ───────────────
        - HR has supreme value.
        + Rebase on the value of R and HR outside of H, because already H is effectively given.
            : privately see notebook:2021-9-10
        - No reasonable end E has greater value than HR.

                  vHR ≥ vE

            ∵ vHR is an aggregate that includes vE.
                ∵ HR includes E.
                    ∵ E is a reasonable end.
                    ∵ All reasonable ends are included in HR.
            ∵ HR excludes all ends of net negative value.
                / The aggregate worth of other included ends cannot be less than zero.
                ∵ HR includes only reasonable ends.
                ∵ No reasonable end N has negative value except where it conditions a further end P
                  of positive value, such that together they have net positive value.

                          vN + vP > 0

                    + Expand to account for multiple N per P.
                        / Viz. multiple conditioning ends of negative value per conditioned end.
        importance of R
            / Why HR, not H alone?
            - R is a limiting condition of the aggregate value that warrants HR, and thereby warrants H.
                : re `aggregate value that warrants HR` see `^^ Warrant$`
            - How far we exercise our capacity for reason (°R, the degree of R)
              affects the aggregate value in three ways.
                i. °R affects justification of the component ends, which in turn
                  determines what they contribute to the aggregate value.
                    : see `^^- An end is reasonable that.+we have reason to value`
                    - Lapses here will tend to lessen the aggregate value of HR
                      by lessening the value of its component ends.
                ii. °R determines the prevalence of will and fitness of means brought to bear
                   on each component end.
                    ∵ The willing of ends and the choosing of means are functions of practical reason.
                    - Lapses here will tend to undermine the aggregate value of HR
                      by threatening the attainment of one or more component ends.
                iii. °R determines the prevalence of will and fitness of means brought to bear on H.
                    : re `°R determines._will.+and.+means brought to.+H` see head @ `^^R is prudent` @
                      `^^ Pragmatic warrant`
                    - Lapses here will pose a threat to the aggregate value of HR by risking a premature
                      extinction that would cut short the attainment of its component ends.

     Note

        H must address ends that are actual
            - Else H would no longer be apodictic.
                : see `^^H is apodictic$`
                ∵ It would require humanity to exist through ends that nobody wills, a requirement
                  that could hardly be apodictic on pragmatic and deontic grounds.
