A deficit of reason

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but left me without a sense of purpose.
    - Unsettled by this, feeling dissatisfied and out of place, I fell from youth onward
      into a restless search for what I lack.
    - I say search, but sometimes a desired end is so far out of sight that one can hardly
      take it as an end unless a means of making progress toward it first presents itself.
        - Purposelessness seemed a thing embedded in society as much the consequence of a deficit
          in myself, and between the two I could resolve no clear object of desire.



    - It is only now, seeing a way toward it beyond society, that I can formulate that object.
    - But I begin by formulating {another | a different} way,
      the one I had looked to society for:

    - It is only now, seeing a way toward it beyond society, that I can [begin to] formulate that object.
    - There are two aspects to it.
    - I begin …

    - It is only now, seeing a way toward it beyond society, that I can formulate that object as follows.



        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.



            - There is but one object of desire, but desire runs through the paths to it, as well.
                crucial+
                + So I begin with another way, which also lies on the path of desire.
            ?+ What does it mean that promise of the night sky — the way it presents —
              obviates my desire for W?
                - Both are means and ways.
                ? Why does the night sky take priority?
                    | it is a clearer way
                    | it is a way to W, too, so prior in that sense
                - W is more a theoretic way, the night sky practical.
                  \ - The practical eclipses the theoretic, which recedes beyond the horizon.
                  \\ wrong: I still long for W, but the night sky shows me how to proceed regardless
                    - A clear guide for action.
                    crucial+



    - Taken as such, it would be an end of which I need no longer ask, ‘To what end?’
      Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
      I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it for its own sake.
        - It is this I desire.
    - I formulate my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.

        principle: Reason in its practical use requires, as the ground of all merely contingent ends,
          an end of absolute worth.

    - Absent such an end, I am rationally bound to go in search of it — I must take W as my end.
        : cf. `^^- Therefore.+bound to.+a best effort at learning what those norms are` @
          moral_uncertainty.brec : Another instance of a binding default norm
          triggered by one’s awareness of normative ignorance.
        : cf. `I must take M as my end\.$` @ moral_uncertainty.brec :
          How W relates to M is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.
        - Counterpart to my desire is a fear of unreason.
    - What W formulates is more commonly referred to as ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in desiring knowledge of it,
          and frequently it is a byword for the unknowable, the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.
                : re `hazards.+barrier` see head @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ We are not confined.

        + Tell how, in terms of the search, it seems to express a covenant.
            + Ensure that ‘Many years ago’ and ‘only now… seeing a way toward it’ above are reconciled,
              it being ‘only now’ that I take the existential convenant to be underwriting a search.

                | Simply say that this promise (of a way, a means) is how I now take it.
            - If you have what it takes to reach me and do not discover what you seek along the way,
              then I will give you time and space unbounded in which to carry on until you do.

    + Correct what follows with a rational demand to will end X, the thing of absolute worth itself.
        / Reason demands the possibility of an end in itself, just as insistently as it demands
          the fact of a cause in itself.
        - ‘… in light of what the clear night reveals …’
        - The clear night reveals that I can will and pursue X directly, without theoretic knowledge
          of it (W); the concept (X) alone suffices.
            crucial+
            - It matters not that I have no *specific* definition of X, I can will it all the same.
        - Moreover my own worth is bound up with attaining X, not of itself W.
            : see notebook:2021-11-9b
        ? If I can will X directly, then how could reason demand W?
            | The willing of X itself entails the willing of W.
                ∵ While I can begin a pursuit of X without W, I can never conclude it without W.
                    ∵ W is necessary to know whether or not X is attained.
          \ | Neither the willing nor attainment of X entail W.
          \     ∵ W is merely prudent for the latter.
          \     + Remove the claim of entailment (rational demand) from W (up above), to X (down here).

    - I seek knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right (W).
    - Only a consensus could validate such knowledge.

        C. A stable consensus on a thing worthy in its own right.

    - A consensus would require a quorum in advance of it.

        H. The rational nature of humankind extant through to C.

    - Whether reason binds me to a concern for C and H beyond the span of my own existence is unclear.
    - But moral duty binds me to such a concern, as the next file shows.
