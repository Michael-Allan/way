A deficit of reason and nightfall’s revelation: the material ground in motivation

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
    - This has unsettled me, prodding me into a long, at times haphazard search for what I lack,
      which I now formulate as follows.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.

        - Taken as such, it would be an end of which I need no longer ask, ‘To what end?’
            - Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
              I would have reason to pursue it for its own sake.
    - I formulate the object of my search in this way because I have come to view the search
      as an attempt to secure my hold on reason.
        - W is a condition of reason in its practical use.
            / Without a worthy end, anything I might do is open to a charge of pointlessness.
        - I seek W in response to a demand of my rational nature.
        / Had I even cause to believe that the latter is worthy in its own right,
          as Kant thought, then my search would be over.
            : re `as Kant thought` see e.g. `^^Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ bibliography.brec :
              ‘… suppose there were something *the existence of which in itself* has an absolute worth,
              that, as an *end in itself*, could be a ground of determinate laws …  Now I say:
              a human being and generally every rational being *exists* as an end in itself,
              *not merely as a means* for the discretionary use for this or that will, but must
              in all its actions, whether directed towards itself or also to other rational beings,
              always be considered *at the same time as an end*.’  4:428
    - The object of my search is commonly referred to as ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in seeking it,
          and often it is a byword for the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a striking thought.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/meaning_in_the_night_sky.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.
                : re `hazards.+barrier` see head @ ../diaspora/meaning_in_the_night_sky.brec
            ⁃ We are not confined.

        + Explain how this moves me.
            + Relate optimal fit.
                - ‘If I tried to relate how this strikes me, I might …’
            + Tell in terms of the search how it seems to express a covenant.
            + Tack.
                - ‘… but if I reflect on what moves me in that direction,
                   what has always move me since the first instant …’
                - Now the recession:
            + Explain the recession of the formal, eclipsed by the material.

                ' … recedes beyond the horizon,
                  {a mere | its formula [expressing nothing but | collapsing to] a} compass point.
                - Gives direction, not only spatial and temporal, but as a means of motion.
                    - It is something to hold on to.
                    - And not only in the far distant future, but also in the present,
                      for confirming my hold is what I do when I pause to look up at the stars.
                        / As though my grip on the rope above [me] could not be established by feel,
                          only by sight.
                    - Reassured of it, I carry on.
