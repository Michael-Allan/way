A deficit of reason and nightfall’s revelation: the material ground in motivation

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
    - Unsettled by this, dissatisfied and feeling out of place, I fell into a long, haphazard
      and restless search for what I lack.
    - Or so it seems in retrospect; sometimes a desired end is so far out of sight that one can
      hardly take it as an end unless a means of making progress toward it first presents itself.
    - It is only now, seeing the way toward it, that I can formulate what I desire as follows.

        W. A thing worthy in its own right.

    - Not knowing of such a thing, I have fallen into a search for what I lack:

        K. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right (W), which I might take as an end.

    - Taken as such, it would be an end of which I need no longer ask, ‘To what end?’
        - Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
          I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it for its own sake.
    - I formulate my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.
    - The possible existence of W is a condition of reason in its practical use.
        - Rational action requires, as the ground of all merely contingent and voluntary ends,
          an end of absolute worth.
        / Absent such an end, anything I might do outside of moral obligation is pointless.
        - Absent such an end, I am rationally bound to go in search of it — I must take K as my end.
            : cf. `^^- Therefore.+bound to.+a best effort at learning what these norms are` : another
              instance of a binding default norm triggered by one’s awareness of normative ignorance.
            / The alternative lies outside the bounds of human nature: an ascetic state of pure
              moral animation — moved by duty alone, shorn of all sense of value — unto death.
        - I seek K in response to a demand of my rational nature.
            / Had I even cause to believe that the latter is worthy in its own right,
              as Kant thought, then my search would be over.
                : re `as Kant thought` see e.g. `^^Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ bibliography.brec :
                  ‘… suppose there were something *the existence of which in itself* has an absolute
                  worth, that, as an *end in itself*, could be a ground of determinate laws …
                  Now I say: a human being and generally every rational being *exists* as an end
                  in itself, *not merely as a means* for the discretionary use for this or that will,
                  but must in all its actions, whether directed towards itself or also to other
                  rational beings, always be considered *at the same time as an end*.’  4:428
    - The object of my search is commonly referred to as ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in wanting for knowledge of it,
          and frequently it is a byword for the unknowable, the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.

        - What struck me then (and stays with me today|now) was …
          secure hold on … eternal and infinite possibilities|opportunity|promise,
          and an immediate escape from a care that had {pressed|weighed on | worried} me.
            - It was a time when a|my sense of purposelessness had long been pressing on me,
              more heavily than ever.
            - So much so that shortly before I had resolved to care nothing for purpose,
              and instead live day by day.

            + Tell in terms of the search how it seems to express a covenant.
                - If you have what it takes to reach me and do not discover what you seek along the way,
                  then I will give you time and space unbounded in which to carry on until you do.

                - It is hard to imagine what more we could ask for, what more we could hope
                  to hold on to, and hard to imagine not reaching for it.
            + Tack.
                - ‘… but if I reflect on what moves me in that direction,
