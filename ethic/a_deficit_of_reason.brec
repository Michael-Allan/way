A deficit of reason

    - The society in which I grew up safeguarded my freedom through its institutions,
      but left me without a sense of purpose.
    - Unsettled by this, feeling dissatisfied and out of place, I fell from youth onward
      into a restless search for what I lack.
    - I call it a search today, but back then it did not seem one.
        - Sometimes a desired goal is so far out of sight that one can hardly take it as a goal
          unless a means of making progress toward it first presents itself.
        - Purposelessness seemed a thing embedded in society as much the consequence of a deficit
          in myself, and between the two I could resolve no clear object of desire.
    - It is only now, seeing a way toward it beyond society, that I can formulate that object as follows.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.

    - Taken as such, it would be an end of which I need no longer ask, ‘To what end?’
      Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
      I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it for its own sake.
        - This was my desire, and it remains so.
    - I explain my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.

        principle: Reason in its practical use requires, as the ground of all merely contingent ends,
          an end of absolute worth.

    - Having no knowledge of such an end, I am rationally bound to go in search of it —
      I must take W as my end.
        : cf. `^^- Therefore.+bound to.+a best effort at learning what those norms are` @
          moral_uncertainty.brec : Another instance of a binding default norm
          triggered by one’s awareness of normative ignorance.
        : cf. `I must take M as my end\.$` @ moral_uncertainty.brec :
          How W relates to M is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.
    - What W formulates is more commonly referred to as ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in desiring knowledge of it,
          and frequently it is a byword for the unknowable, the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.

        + Tell how, in terms of the search, it seems to express a covenant.
            + Ensure that ‘Many years ago’ and ‘only now… seeing a way toward it’ above are reconciled,
              it being ‘only now’ that I take the existential convenant to be underwriting a search.

                | Simply say that this promise (of a way, a means) is how I now take it.
            - If you have what it takes to reach me and do not discover what you seek along the way,
              then I will give you time and space unbounded in which to carry on until you do.

    - Seeing a way foward and being moved to take it is what finally enables me to give form
      to the search in which I am engaged.
    - Hitherto, I was not so much moved to the pursuit of an end as pushed about aimlessly for lack
      of knowledge of an end worth pursuing; whereas now, in light of what the clear night reveals,
      I have enough knowledge to formulate both my desired end and the necessary means to it.



        ! Incoherent: I still lack knowledge of X.
            - It is merely an abstract end on which I hang the revealed means.

    - That end is simply the one which reason demands:

        X. A thing worthy in its own right, an absolute good.



    + Clarify: X is merely abstract.
    + Claim that nevertheless, I can obtain some knowledge of it.
        / Both analytic and synthetic.
    - Necessarily the attainment of X lies in the future.
        - Reason cannot (contrary to reason) demand an end that already is attained.
    - It follows that never can X be fully attained, or always the attainment of another X awaits.
    + Interpret the latter, plural possibility as one that would offer a choice of which X (or Xs)
      to pursue.

    + Premptively dismiss (by choice) any X (of the plural possibility) unique to me.

                / The plausibility that C’s attainment lies far in the future
                  is enough to warrant treating it as such.

    - X is unattainable unless we continue to exist.

        - Bring in even the comforting conjecture that the revelation/covenant is a real communication,
          the refuge we hope to enter being the artifact of a prior community we would thereby join.
            : see notebook:2021-11-15d : even though I crossed it out



    - Reason binds me to an end of absolute worth, one that probably lies far beyond the span of my life,
      and informs me that nevertheless my own worth depends on its attainment.
        + Relate to my original experience of desire and subsequent interpretation of it as a felt need.

    ∴ I take X as my end, and with it W, C and H.
