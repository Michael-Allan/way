A deficit of reason

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
        + Tell the subjective consequence(s) of this, referent of the motive that follows.
        - This moves me to seek what I lack:

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.

            / It would be an end of which I need no longer ask, â€˜To what end?â€™

    - In pursuing W, I pursue a condition of practical reason.
        - W is a demand of my rational nature, a demand for rational self integrity.
        / Had I even cause to believe that either of these was worthy in its own right,
          then my search would be over.



    + Qualify the â€˜rationalâ€™ of R as hypothetical, hinging on the attainment or attainability of P.
        - I am moved to action not by reason, but by a deficit of reason.
