A deficit of reason

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
        + Tell the subjective consequence(s) of this, referent of the motive that follows.
    - This moves me to seek what I lack, which I now formulate as follows.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.

        - It would be an end of which I need no longer ask, â€˜To what end?â€™
            - Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
              I would have reason to pursue it for its own sake.
    - In seeking W, I endeavour to secure a hold on reason.
        - W is a condition of reason in its practical use.
        - I am moved to obtain it in response to a demand of my rational nature.
        / Had I even cause to believe that the latter is worthy in its own right,
          as Kant thought, then my search would be over.
            : re `as Kant thought` see e.g. `^^Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ bibliography.brec :
              â€˜â€¦ suppose there were something *the existence of which in itself* has an absolute worth,
              that, as an *end in itself*, could be a ground of determinate laws â€¦  Now I say:
              a human being and generally every rational being *exists* as an end in itself,
              *not merely as a means* for the discretionary use for this or that will, but must
              in all its actions, whether directed towards itself or also to other rational beings,
              always be considered *at the same time as an end*.â€™  4:428
    - Two common phrases â€” â€˜the purpose of lifeâ€™ and â€˜the meaning of lifeâ€™ â€” remind me both that
      I am not alone in my search, and that what I seek is often a byword for the unattainable.
        / Reasonâ€™s demands are as difficult as they are insistent.



    + Qualify the â€˜rationalâ€™ of R as hypothetical, hinging on the attainment or attainability of P.
        - I am moved to action not by reason, but by a deficit of reason.
