A deficit of reason and nightfall’s revelation: the material ground in motivation

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
    - Unsettled by this, restless and dissatisfied, I fell into a long, haphazard search for what I lack.
    + Explain the sense of this framing, without which the narrative here is jarring.
        - It is only in retrospect that I can frame it as a search because, framed as such,
          one immediately gains a sense of purpose.
        ? Then the search would come to an end.  How can that make sense?
            - It makes sense in the way of default reasons, the way e.g. that W can stand in
              for its object.
            - So I would have gained a default purpose, which is to search for purpose.
            ? But does it not take something *more* to make that work?
                - Yes, it takes a means of progress.  Sometimes an end is so cluelessly difficult,
                  so elusive, that one cannot take it seriously *as an end* unless a means
                  first presents itself and one sees its extraordinary potential.
                - It is only after discovering such a means that I am now able to frame the search
                  as such, and formulate its object as follows.
                    go with this+
    - What I lack, I can now formulate as follows.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.

        - Taken as such, it would be an end of which I need no longer ask, ‘To what end?’
            - Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
              I would pursue it for its own sake.
    - Formulating the object of my search in this way, I view the search as an attempt to secure
      my hold on reason.
        - W is a condition of reason in its practical use.
            / Without a worthy end, anything I might do is open to a charge of pointlessness.
        - I seek W in response to a demand of my rational nature.
        / Had I even cause to believe that the latter is worthy in its own right,
          as Kant thought, then my search would be over.
            : re `as Kant thought` see e.g. `^^Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ bibliography.brec :
              ‘… suppose there were something *the existence of which in itself* has an absolute worth,
              that, as an *end in itself*, could be a ground of determinate laws …  Now I say:
              a human being and generally every rational being *exists* as an end in itself,
              *not merely as a means* for the discretionary use for this or that will, but must
              in all its actions, whether directed towards itself or also to other rational beings,
              always be considered *at the same time as an end*.’  4:428
    - The object of my search is commonly referred to as ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in seeking it,
          and often it is a byword for the unattainable.
        ?+ Need I state here the consequence of finding a means of making progress toward it?
            | Yet its ultimate attainability is less of a concern, provided we have a means
              of making progress toward it.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a striking thought.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.

            ⁃ We are not confined.

        + Explain how this moves me.
            + Relate optimal fit.
                - ‘If I tried to relate how this strikes me, I might …’
            + Tell in terms of the search how it seems to express a covenant.
            + Tack.
                - ‘… but if I reflect on what moves me in that direction,
                   what has always move me since the first instant …’
                - Now the recession:
            + Explain the recession of the formal, eclipsed by the material.

                ' … recedes beyond the horizon …
                - Refer not to the formula.
                - Interpret no meaning at all, simply draw a line under it.
