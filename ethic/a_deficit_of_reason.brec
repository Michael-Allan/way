A deficit of reason and nightfall’s revelation: the material ground in motivation

    + Say I am bound by reason (and so cross-link with the other ground) to take W as my end.
        : re `cross-link` see ./ : as the two files’ boneyards do so
        ?+ Is that true here, as for its moral equivalent in the other file?
            ?+ Regardless, is it not enough in keeping to the present type of ground
              (and the purpose of this file) to say I am so moved?
            ?+ On the other hand, regardless of how *binding* it is, is it not enough that it confers
              a kind of default reason (however binding) that I should indicate the interesting
              correlation, at least as an aside (as does the example in the boneyard)?
            !! Deal with this now.
                - It may entail a reframing.
    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
    - Unsettled by this, dissatisfied and feeling out of place, I fell into a long, haphazard
      and restless search for what I lack.
        - Or so it seems in retrospect.
        - Sometimes a desired object is so far out of sight that one can hardly take it as one’s object
          unless a means of making progress toward it first presents itself.
    - It is only now, seeing a way toward it, that I can formulate what I desire as follows.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.

        - Taken as such, it would be an end of which I need no longer ask, ‘To what end?’
            - Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
              I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it for its own sake.
    - I formulate my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.
        + Consider underlining herein (or by footnote), with regard to fear on slippage of *means*
          (also evidence of the felt need, which I may say that nobody doubts), that the same applies
          to the end.
        - W is a condition of reason in its practical use.
            / Without a worthy end, anything I might do is open to a charge of pointlessness.
        - I seek W in response to a demand of my rational nature.
        / Had I even cause to believe that the latter is worthy in its own right,
          as Kant thought, then my search would be over.
            : re `as Kant thought` see e.g. `^^Kant.+1785.+Groundwork` @ bibliography.brec :
              ‘… suppose there were something *the existence of which in itself* has an absolute worth,
              that, as an *end in itself*, could be a ground of determinate laws …  Now I say:
              a human being and generally every rational being *exists* as an end in itself,
              *not merely as a means* for the discretionary use for this or that will, but must
              in all its actions, whether directed towards itself or also to other rational beings,
              always be considered *at the same time as an end*.’  4:428
    - The object of my search is commonly referred to as ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in seeking knowledge of it,
          and often it is a byword for the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a striking thought.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.
                : re `hazards.+barrier` see head @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ We are not confined.

        + Explain how this moves me.
            + Relate optimal fit.
                - ‘If I tried to relate how this strikes me, I might …’
            + Tell in terms of the search how it seems to express a covenant.
            + Tack.
                - ‘… but if I reflect on what moves me in that direction,
                   what has always move me since the first instant …’
                - Now the recession:
            + Explain the recession of the formal, eclipsed by the material.

                ' … recedes beyond the horizon …
                - Refer not to the formula.
                - Interpret no meaning at all, simply draw a line under it.
