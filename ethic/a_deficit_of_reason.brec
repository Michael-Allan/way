A deficit of reason

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
    - Unsettled by this, feeling dissatisfied and out of place, I fell from youth onward
      into a restless search for what I lack.
    - I say search, but sometimes a desired end is so far out of sight that one can hardly
      take it as an end unless a means of making progress toward it first presents itself.
        - Purposelessness seemed to me a thing embedded in society, not a deficit in myself
          from which I could resolve a clear object of desire.
    - It is only now, seeing a way toward it, that I can formulate my object as follows.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.

    - Taken as such, it would be an end of which I need no longer ask, ‘To what end?’
      Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
      I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it for its own sake.
    - I formulate my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.

        principle: Reason in its practical use requires, as the ground of all merely contingent ends,
          an end of absolute worth.

    - Absent such an end, I am rationally bound to go in search of it — I must take W as my end.

          moral_uncertainty.brec : Another instance of a binding default norm
          triggered by the awareness of normative ignorance.
        : cf. `I must take M as my end\.$` @ moral_uncertainty.brec :
          How W relates to M is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.
    - What W formulates is more commonly referred to as ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in desiring knowledge of it,
          and frequently it is a byword for the unknowable, the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.

        + Tell how, in terms of the search, it seems to express a covenant.
            - If you have what it takes to reach me and do not discover what you seek along the way,
              then I will give you time and space unbounded in which to carry on until you do.

            + Ensure that ‘Many years ago’ and ‘only now… seeing a way toward it’ above are reconciled,
              it being ‘only now’ that I take the existential convenant to be underwriting a search.

    - W requires a prior consensus regarding …

        C. A stable consensus on …

    - C requires a quorum in advance of it.

        H. The rational nature of humankind extant through to C.

    - I have reason to take W as my end, and with it C and H.
