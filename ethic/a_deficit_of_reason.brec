A deficit of reason

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but left me without a sense of purpose.
    - Unsettled by this, feeling dissatisfied and out of place, I fell from youth onward
      into a restless search for what I lack.
    - I say search, but sometimes a desired end is so far out of sight that one can hardly
      take it as an end unless a means of making progress toward it first presents itself.
        - Purposelessness seemed a thing embedded in society as much the consequence of a deficit
          in myself, and between the two I could resolve no clear object of desire.
    - It is only now, seeing a way toward it beyond society, that I can formulate that object as follows.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right, which I might take as an end.

    - Taken as such, it would be an end of which I need no longer ask, ‘To what end?’
      Alone it would suffice.  Its value being contingent on no other end,
      I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it for its own sake.
        - It is this I had desired.
    - I formulate my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.

        principle: Reason in its practical use requires, as the ground of all merely contingent ends,
          an end of absolute worth.

    - Having no knowledge of such an end, I am rationally bound to go in search of it —
      I must take W as my end.
        : cf. `^^- Therefore.+bound to.+a best effort at learning what those norms are` @
          moral_uncertainty.brec : Another instance of a binding default norm
          triggered by one’s awareness of normative ignorance.
        : cf. `I must take M as my end\.$` @ moral_uncertainty.brec :
          How W relates to M is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.
        - Counterpart to my desire is a fear of unreason.
    - What W formulates is more commonly referred to as ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in desiring knowledge of it,
          and frequently it is a byword for the unknowable, the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.
                : re `hazards.+barrier` see head @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ We are not confined.
                : see `^^we are not confined$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
        + Tell how, in terms of the search, it seems to express a covenant.
            + Ensure that ‘Many years ago’ and ‘only now… seeing a way toward it’ above are reconciled,
              it being ‘only now’ that I take the existential convenant to be underwriting a search.

                | Simply say that this promise (of a way, a means) is how I now take it.
            - If you have what it takes to reach me and do not discover what you seek along the way,
              then I will give you time and space unbounded in which to carry on until you do.

    - Seeing a way foward and being moved to take it is what finally enables me to give form
      to the search in which I am engaged.
    - Hitherto, I was not so much moved to the pursuit of an end as pushed about aimlessly for lack
      of knowledge of an end worth pursuing; whereas now, in light of what the clear night reveals,
      I have enough knowledge to formulate both my desired end and the necessary means to it.
    - That end is simply the one which reason demands:

        X. A thing worthy in its own right.

    - Knowledge of what X consists in (W) is still necessary, and that knowledge will require
      a consensus to validate it.

        C. A stable consensus on a thing worthy in its own right.

        : re `W` see `^^W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right`
    - But neither C nor W stands as an obstacle to the pursuit if X through other means.
    - Above all, attaining X requires that we continue to exist.

        H. The rational nature of humankind extant through C and W to X.

    - Reason and desire have conspired to move me to pursue an end of absolute worth,
      one that probably lies far beyond the span of my life, and have done so
      through an awareness that my own worth depends on its attainment.
    ∴ I take X as my end, and with it W, C and H.
