Duty and desire

    - Let moral certainty (M) be defined as follows.

        M. A reasonably held belief that one knows what norms morally bind one.

    - M requires a consensus (C) regarding the cosmic fit.

        C. Consensus on what the cosmic fit implies for normative ethics.

    - C requires a quorum in advance of it.

        H. Humanity extant through to C.

    - Each of us has reason to take M as an end, and with it C and H.
    - A formal reason is given in the next section, substansive in the section after.

        - C being unattained at present, I know myself to be in a state of moral uncertainty.
        - I have reason to suspect that one or more norms are morally binding on me,
          of which I am ignorant.
        - Therefore I am duty bound to make a best effort at learning what these norms are, if any.
            - I must take M as my end.
