Precarious conditions of rational action

    + Begin with the notebookâ€™s powerful summary (as it still seems) of the argument.
        : see notebook:2021-10-13f,16a,23b,26b
        : see notebook:2021-10-13g : Its utility now escapes me, it may be an orphan
          of later developments.
        + In the final sentence that ushers what â€˜gives me entry|access to that society and ethicâ€™,
          this is no longer the formula of a postulate/premise, but rather recognition
          that rational action is necessary to the bounden ends.
            : re `gives me entry\|access` see notebook:2021-10-13f
    + Claim that rational action and its conditions are entailed in willing the bounden ends,
      and promise to justify this claim shortly.
    + Resolve the precarious conditions of rational action.
        - Resolve them as those safeguarded and supported by the institutions of contemporary society
          on one hand, and medieval and early-modern societies on the other.

        necessity: how willing the bounden ends entails a requirement for ends justification
            - One must critically examine oneâ€™s ends to ensure that no unjustifiable (and therefore
              unreasonable) end conflicts with a bounden end, as that would be contrary to duty.
                / This requires ends justification.
            - Such a conflict would not be open to arbitration by prudence because an unjustifiable end
              weighs nothing in the balance against duty.

        / A precarious condition of rational action.
        necessity: how willing the bounden ends entails a requirement for personal freedom
            - Willing the bounden ends entails prudential action toward those ends,
              even if that comprises no more than the act of maintaining a watch
              to ensure that no further action is (at present) called for.
                : cf. notebook:2021-9-28b,30g : re attainment of ends by chance alone
                - Our rational nature does not bestow the capacity to plot a determinate course of action
                  to such distant ends as these.  Necessarily we rely on prudence.
            - Prudential action requires a degree of personal freedom.
                / This is self evident.
                !! How can the necessity of a mere *degree* of personal freedom yield a useful right?
                    ?+ Might the necessity of prudential action plus the fact that its scope
                      is proportional to freedom (expanding with freedom) clear a path of right
                      for any degree of freedom, at least where it is justifiable or not morally wrong?
                  \ ?+ Might the entitlement of right extend instead to whatever reasonably could
                  \   (in the event) be entailed in the willing of the bounden ends,
                  \   as opposed to what necessarily (a priori) is?
                  \     : cf. notebook:2021-10-25b
                  \\    - Clearly no, as reasonably that could be anything, even horrific acts.
                  \ ?+ Might the entitlement of right extend instead to whatever might (in the event)
                  \   be entailed in the willing of the bounden ends, as opposed to what necessarily
                  \   (a priori) is?
                  \     : see notebook:2021-10-25b
                  \\    - Moot, as we have little capacity to determine a fact of entailment.
                  \         : see `^^- Our rational nature does not bestow the capacity`
                  \ | A degree deemable as sufficient for action is necessary for action to proceed.
                  \\    - Yet that yields only a right of *minimally* sufficient freedom.
                    + Ensure that any remedial postulate is deferred to precisely where it is wanted.
