Precarious conditions of rational action

    + Begin with the notebookâ€™s powerful summary (as it still seems) of the argument.
        : see notebook:2021-10-13f,16a,23b,26b
        : see notebook:2021-10-13g : Its utility now escapes me, it may be an orphan
          of later developments.
        + In the final sentence that ushers what â€˜gives me entry|access to that society and ethicâ€™,
          this is no longer the formula of a postulate/premise, but rather recognition
          that rational action is necessary to the bounden ends.
            : re `gives me entry\|access` see notebook:2021-10-13f
    + Claim that rational action [with its conditions] is entailed in willing the bounden ends,
      and promise to justify this claim shortly.
    + Resolve the precarious conditions of rational action.
        - Resolve them as those safeguarded and supported by the institutions of contemporary society
          on one hand, and medieval and early-modern societies on the other.

        / A precarious condition of rational action, namely that of justifying oneâ€™s ends.
        necessity
            / How willing the bounden ends entails a requirement for ends justification.
            - One must critically examine oneâ€™s ends to ensure that no unjustifiable (and therefore
              unreasonable) end conflicts with a bounden end, as that would be contrary to duty.
                / This requires ends justification.
            - Such a conflict would not be open to arbitration by prudence because an unjustifiable end
              weighs nothing in the balance against duty.

        / A precarious condition of rational action.
        necessity
            / How willing the bounden ends entails a requirement for personal freedom.
            - Willing the bounden ends entails prudential action toward those ends,
              even if that comprises no more than the act of maintaining a watch
              to ensure that no further action is (at present) called for.
                !! Maintaining a watch entails thought, not action.

                : cf. notebook:2021-9-28b,30g : re attainment of ends by chance alone
                / We are unable to plot a determinate course of action to such distant ends as these.
                  Necessarily we rely on prudence.
            - Prudential action requires personal freedom.
                / This is self evident.
