Precarious conditions

    + Begin with the notebookâ€™s powerful summary (as it still seems) of the argument.
        : see notebook:2021-10-13f,16a,23b,26b,27g
        : N.B. notebook:2021-9-20a : optimal fit, which could be described earlier
            : re `earlier` see e.g. `Relate optimal fit` @ ._/a_deficit_of_reason_boneyard.brec
        : N.B. notebook 2021-11-8d : an objection to consider
        + Consider for salvage:
            - We see there {in what nightfall reveals} a formal thing like an ethic,
              a form for what matters, a structure that cradles a thing of value.
        + In the final sentence that ushers what â€˜gives me entry|access to that society and ethicâ€™,
          this is no longer the formula of a postulate/premise, but rather recognition
          that rational action is necessary to the bounden ends.

        + Resolve the precarious conditions of rational action.
            / Viz. those apt to be suboptimally realized.
            : see notebook:2021-8-5g
            - Resolve them as those safeguarded and supported by the institutions of contemporary society
              on one hand, and medieval and early-modern societies on the other.
        + Explain how they condition rational action.
            : see notebook:2021-11-13c
        ends justification
            / Viz. justifying oneâ€™s ends.
            + Suggest a relation between ends justification and freedom of will (as opposed to action).
                / To hang references on, not theory, which surely has already been worked out.
                + Hang references on that suggestion.
                    : see `^^Schneewind.+1998.+The invention of autonomy` @ bibliography.brec : p. 290.4.
                      His quote of Harrington is promising, though he does not discuss it in this light.
                    + Read Honderichâ€™s *How free are you?*.
        freedom of action

        ends justification
            - Willing the bounden ends entails, through practical reasoning, a requirement
              for ends justification.
            âˆµ One must critically examine oneâ€™s ends to ensure that no unjustifiable (and therefore
              unreasonable) end conflicts with a bounden end, as that would be contrary to duty.
            - Such conflict would not be open to arbitration by prudence because an unjustifiable end
              weighs nothing in the balance against duty.
        freedom of action
            - Willing the bounden ends entails, through practical reasoning and rational action,
              a requirement for freedom of action.
            - Willing the bounden ends entails rational action directed to those ends.
                - It entails thought *at the least*, and thought requires action to sustain it.
                - One must keep oneself going.
                    / The only exceptions that obtain in practice are an incapacity for self maintenance
                      or a resolution to die.
                - Normally, of course, we need no prompting from duty.  Nature has equipped us
                  to carry on and continues to urge that we do.  But that duty also enjoins it
                  matters if, from this fact, by way of an ethic of clear norms, we can inform
                  the structure of a society that better supports it, a society that bridges
                  the gap between what nature has bestowed and the macrocosm promises.
                    !! Dutyâ€™s urging is personal only.

            - Rational action in turn requires freedom of action.
                / This is self evident.
