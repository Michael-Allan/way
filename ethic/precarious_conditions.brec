Precarious conditions of rational action

        : N.B. notebook:2021-11-8d : an objection to consider
        + Consider for salvage:
            - We see there {in what nightfall reveals} a formal thing like an ethic,
              a form for what matters, a structure that cradles a thing of value.
        + In the final sentence that ushers what â€˜gives me entry|access to that society and ethicâ€™,
          this is no longer the formula of a postulate/premise, but rather the recognition
          that the bounden ends entail (at least some) conditions of rational action.

            - Willing the bounden ends entails, through practical reasoning, a requirement
              for ends justification.
            âˆµ One must critically examine oneâ€™s ends to ensure that no unjustifiable end
              conflicts with a bounden end, as that would be contrary to duty.
                + For this purpose, define unjustifiable as both unreasonable (rationally ungrounded)
                  and amoral.

            - Such a conflict would not be open to arbitration by prudence because an unjustifiable end
              weighs nothing in the balance against duty.

        freedom of action
            : cf. @ `^+inference of conditions$`
            - Willing the bounden ends entails, through practical reasoning and action,
              a requirement for freedom of action.
            - Willing the bounden ends entails action directed to those ends.
            - It entails thought *at the least*, and thought requires action to sustain it.
              One must keep oneself going.
                / The only exceptions that obtain in practice are an incapacity for self maintenance
                  or a resolution to die.
                / Normally, of course, one needs no prompting from duty.  Nature has equipped us
                  to carry on both individually and collectively, and continues to urge that we do.
                  But *that duty also enjoins it* matters if, from this fact, by way of an ethic
                  of clear norms, we can inform the structure of a society that better supports it,
                  a society that bridges the gap between what nature has bestowed and the cosmos
                  at large promises.
