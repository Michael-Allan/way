Precarious conditions of rational action

    + Begin with the notebook‚Äôs powerful summary (as it still seems) of the argument.
        : see notebook:2021-10-13f
        : see notebook:2021-10-13g : Its utility now escapes me, it may be an orphan
          of later developments.
        : see notebook:2021-10-16a
        + In the final sentence that ushers in the succeeding formula of the postulate/premise
          which in turn ‚Äògives me entry|access to that society and ethic‚Äô, qualify the formula
          as {being | appearing to be} what *most simply and directly* would do so.
            : re `succeeding formula` see `^^\+ Formulate a ‚Äòpostulate‚Äô or ‚Äòpremise`
            : re `gives me entry|access` see notebook:2021-10-13f
            : re `most simply and directly` see `^^\+ Justify it on a principle of parsimony\.$`
    + Formulate a ‚Äòpostulate‚Äô or ‚Äòpremise‚Äô to further the ethic.
        : see `^^\+ Fall back on a further postulate\.$` @ action_plan.brec
        + Justify it on a principle of parsimony.

            / I am inspired here by Schneewind‚Äôs reading of Grotius, where I detect a similar principle.
                : cf. `^^Schneewind.+1998.+The invention of autonomy` @ bibliography.brec : Grotius‚Äôs
                  ‚Äòunderstanding of the depth and imporatance of the problem of maintaining the social
                  order leads him [in *On the law of war and peace*, 1625] to a new way of understanding
                  natural law. ‚Ä¶ while he deplores the present ‚Äúlack of restraint‚Äù in war and the haste
                  with which men engage in it, he nowhere condemns it as such.  Controversy with war as
                  the most extreme form is one of the facts of life.  We are self-preserving and
                  quarrelsome beings; but we are also sociable.  These two aspects of human nature make
                  the problem of maintaining the social order quite definite.  How are quarrelsome but
                  socially minded beings like ourselves to live together?  What limits must we place on
                  our tendency to controversy in order to satisfy our sociable desires?‚Äô  p. 72
            + Make ‚Äòdefinite‚Äô (as Schneewind says) the problem I am solving with this postulate.
                | How prevent a state of moral uncertainty undermining the means of escaping that state?
                    - We are caught in a [kind of] trap.
                    - On that account, we run a high risk of going extinct long before
                      we reach the existential refuge afforded by the cosmos.
            + Tell how the cosmic refuge, *appears* to be an application of the same principle,
              problem and solution (non-hindrance).
                - It offers in future a way out of the trap.
                - It shows in the present, by that example, a way out of the trap.
                    / As though it were a rope or ladder hanging from above.
        + Justify it further.
