Rights: moral entitlements, aka human rights

    - Being bound by duty to will certain ends (the bounden ends), one is entitled to will those ends
      and thereby to all that necessarily attends the willing of them.
        / Viz. to the conditions and entailments of so willing.
        - This by the following principle.

            principle: What is enjoined by duty is entitled by right.

    - Willing the bounden ends entails rational action directed to those ends,
      and thereby entails the conditions of that action.

        - Among these conditions, two were identified as being at risk and are here formulated as rights.
            : see `^^ ends justification$`
            : see `^^ personal freedom$`

    boundary translations: scope of duty â†’ scope of rights
        - Dutyâ€™s entailment of the conditions of rational action is constrained in scope; it entails them
          only where they apply to practical reasoning and rational action in regard to the bounden ends.

            : re `entailment` see `^^necessity$` @ `^^ personal freedom$` @ precarious_conditions.brec
        - Yet in formulating oneâ€™s right to these conditions, no such constraint can be applied.
            âˆµ Singling out the bounden ends alone as worthy of moral sanction would verge on disparaging
              all other utmost ends, thereby on violating the right of ends justification.

                  `^^- A specific violation.+is to.+disparage an utmost end`
        - For sake of coherence, then, the constraint must be omitted from the formulae of right.
        - The principle of this omission is:

            principle: Where the scope of duty falls short of what a clear and coherent formulation of
              the corresponding right requires, the scope of the right is extended by the shortfall.

        - Moreover, aside from their constraint to particular ends, the bounds of duty are unclear
          in its entailment of the conditions of rational action.
            / Where, when and to what extent is access to these conditions entailed by duty?
              What degree of personal freedom, for instance?  What capacity for ends justification?
            - In any case, the only bounds clearly formulable are the maximum ones.
            - For sake of clarity, then, the formulae of right entitle one to unrestricted access.

            right: (perfect) To justify oneâ€™s ends.

        - A specific violation of this right is to deride or disparage an utmost end.
            / This violation is notable in that it does not simultaneously violate the right of freedom.

        - Freedoms are inherently prone to conflict, as is their establishment.
        - The right of unhindered freedom, unencumbered by conflict, is therefore an imperfect one.

            right: (imperfect) Personal freedom.

        - Yet freedom rests on a condition that is not prone to conflict.
        - It rests on a condition of personal security.

            right: (perfect) The security of oneâ€™s person.

        - Formal division of the right into perfect and imperfect halves is necessary
          for sake of clarity and coherence.
