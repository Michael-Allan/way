Rights: moral entitlements, aka human rights

    - Being bound by duty to will certain ends (the bounden ends), one is entitled to will those ends
      and thereby to all that necessarily attends the willing of them.
        / Viz. to the conditions and entailments of so willing.
        - This by the following principle.

            principle: What is enjoined by duty is entitled by right.

    - Willing the bounden ends entails rational action in pursuit of those ends.
        : see `^^\+ Claim that rational action.+is entailed` @ precarious_conditions.brec
    - Among the conditions of rational action, two were identified as being at risk
      and are here formulated as rights.
        - Dutyâ€™s entailment of these conditions is constrained in scope; it entails them only where
          they apply to rational action toward the bounden ends.
            : re `entailment` see `^^necessity$` @ `^^ ends justification$` @ precarious_conditions.brec
            : re `entailment` see `^^necessity$` @ `^^ personal freedom$` @ precarious_conditions.brec
        - Yet in formulating oneâ€™s right to these conditions, no such constraint can be applied.
            âˆµ Singling out the bounden ends alone as worthy of moral sanction would verge on disparaging
              all other utmost ends, thereby on violating the right of ends justification.
                : re `violating.+ends justification` see
                  `^^- A specific violation.+is to.+disparage an utmost end`
        - For sake of coherence, then, the constraint must be omitted from the formulae of right.
        - The principle of this omission is:

            principle: Where the bounds of duty fall short of what a clear and coherent formulation of
              the corresponding right requires, the bounds of the right are extended by the shortfall.

        - Moreover, aside from their constraint to particular ends, the bounds of duty are unclear
          in their entailment of the conditions of rational action.
            / Where, when and to what extent is access to these conditions entailed by duty?
              What degree of personal freedom, for instance?  What capacity for ends justification?
            - In any case, the only bounds clearly formulable are those of totally unhindered access.
            - For sake of clarity, then, the formulae of right entitle one to unhindered access.

            right: To justify oneâ€™s ends.

        - A specific violation of this right is to deride or disparage an utmost end.
            / This violation is notable in that it does not simultaneously violate the right of freedom.

        - Freedoms are inherently prone to conflict, as is their establishment.
        - The right of unhindered freedom, unencumbered by conflict, is therefore an imperfect one.

            right: (imperfect) Personal freedom.

        - Yet freedom rests on a condition that is not prone to conflict.
        - It rests on a condition of personal security.

            right: (perfect) The security of oneâ€™s person.

        - A formal division of the right into perfect and imperfect halves is necessary
          for sake of clarity and coherence.
