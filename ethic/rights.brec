Rights: moral entitlements, aka human rights

    + Warrant thus: what morality enjoins by duty it entitles by right.
        / This is self evident.
        - As one is bound by duty to will certain ends, one is entitled to will those ends
          and thereby entitled to the conditions and entailments of willing them.
            : re `conditions and entailments` see precarious_conditions.brec
    ends justification
    personal freedom
        - The bounden ends require freedom in their pursuit, though not necessarily in any other pursuit.
            : see @ precarious_conditions.brec
            - Yet the corresponding right of freedom cannot be constrained to the bounden ends.
                âˆµ A constraint to particular ends would contradict the requirement of ends justification,
                  which by its nature cannot be so constrained.
                    - Favouring a particular end in the very formulation of right
                      would be too close to a formal disparagement of other ends.
                âˆµ A constraint to particular ends would sit too uneasily with the concept of freedom.
                    / It would be like Ford offering â€˜a car painted any colourâ€¦ so long as it is black.â€™

            - Coherence demands a right of freedom constrained at most by other types of right
              and the rights of other persons.
