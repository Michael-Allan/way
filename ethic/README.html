<h1 lang='en-CA'>The default morals of a rational nature at risk</h1>
<section lang='en-CA'>
    <p>
        These files develop a normative ethic from grounds in moral uncertainty and a failure of reason
        through an entailed care for the enabling conditions of rational action.  While the files
        may be read in any order, they were written with a particular order in mind:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href='http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/ethic/a_failure_of_reason.brec'>
                     A failure of reason</a></li>
        <li><a href='moral_uncertainty.brec'>
                     Moral uncertainty</a></li>
