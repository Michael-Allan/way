<section lang='en-CA'>
    <p>
        These files describe a normative ethic grounded on the value of an on-going existence
        for humanity, and elaborated through an entailed commitment to the conditions of reason.</p>
    <p>
        While the files may be read in any order, they were written with a particular order in mind:</p>
    <ol>
