A failure of reason: the ground of motivation

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
    - My enduring desire is a clear, sure sense of purpose, and I formulate what would satisfy it.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right (X), which I might take as an end.

    - Taken as such, X would be an end of which I need not ask, ‘To what end?’  Alone it would suffice.
      Its value being contingent on no other end, I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it
      for its own sake.
        - This would satisfy my desire.
    - I explain my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.

        principle: Reason in its practical use requires, as the ground of all merely contingent ends,
          an end of absolute worth.

    - Having no knowledge of such an end — cognizant of nothing that would qualify, no X —
      I am rationally bound to go in search of that knowledge.  I must take W as my end.
        : cf. `^^- Therefore.+bound to.+a best effort at learning what those norms are` @
          moral_uncertainty.brec : Another instance of a binding default norm
          triggered by one’s awareness of normative ignorance.
        : cf. `I must take M as my end\.$` @ moral_uncertainty.brec :
          How W relates to M is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.
        + Clarify that mere belief based on plausibility will not suffice here, as it would in the case
          of deliberating over means whose choice was open to prudence.  One must be certain of the end
          that serves as ground.
    - So it is a failure of reason that brings on my desire for a sense of purpose, a failure
      owing to the fault of having no X as an end, which in turn I can redress only through W.
    - W is knowledge of what is commonly called ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in desiring it, and frequently it is a byword
          for the unknowable, the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.
                : re `hazards.+barrier` see head @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ We are not confined.
                : see `^^we are not confined$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
        + Tell how *nowadays* I take it to express a covenant in terms of the search.
                : re `nowadays` cf. `^^- Many years ago, I had a thought`
                : re `nowadays` see `^^- I.+have come to understand it`
            - If you have what it takes to reach me and do not discover what you seek along the way,
              then I will give you time and space unbounded in which to carry on until you do.

    - Seeing a way foward and being moved to take it without also seeing the destination
      is what eventually brought me to understand that I am engaged in a search.
    - Again, I formulate the object of that search.  What I seek is:

        W. Knowledge of an absolute good, a thing worthy in its own right.

        + Clarify: W must be complete enough to allow a determination of whether the good is attained
          and, if necessary, maintained or held.
    - Only a stable consensus can validate knowledge on a topic that lies open to controversy.
        : re `open to controversy` see `frequently it is a byword\R +for the unknowable`

        C. A stable consensus on an absolute good.

        + Warrant this claim.
            : join @ `^^- Only.consensus can validate` @ moral_uncertainty.brec : by referring hence
    - A stable consensus requires a sustained quorum.

        H. The rational macrocommunity of humankind extant through C to W.

        + Define the ‘rational macrocommunity of humankind’.
            : join @ `^^H\. ` @ moral_uncertainty.brec
    - In binding me to an end (W) that is necessarily collective (C), reason has bound me
      to the interim maintenance (H) of the collective itself.
    - Short of these ends, no alternatives exist within the bounds of reason.
        : cf. `no alternatives exist within moral bounds\.$` @ moral_uncertainty.brec
        - W is unlikely to be attained in my own time.  But even if I judged it unattainable,
          it would remain the only rational basis for action on my part.
        !! If willing W suffices as a rational basis (as indeed it must in order to speak
          of rational action later), then the rhetoric of the present file is incoherent.
            - What society leaves me without is not a sense of purpose, but W:
              knowledge of a worthy end to pursue, or of a worthy pursuit.
                + Do not imply that society leaves me (in present terms) without a sense of purpose.
                - I may have lacked a sure sense of purpose in the past, but now I have one in W.
                    + Ensure that my present desire, at least, is given as W.
            - Reason failed me in the past, but not at present.
                - It was not an enduring failure like moral uncertainty is;
                  the enduring failure here is an axiologic one.
                + Correct the references to failure
                + Rename this file.
                    | axiologic uncertainty
    ∴ I take W as my end, and with it C and H.
