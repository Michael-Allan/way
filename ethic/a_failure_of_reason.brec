A failure of reason: the ground of motivation

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
    - My enduring desire is a clear, sure sense of purpose, and I formulate what would satisfy it.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right (X), which I might take as an end.

    - Taken as such, X would be an end of which I need not ask, ‘To what end?’  Alone it would suffice.
      Its value being contingent on no other end, I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it
      for its own sake.
        - This would satisfy my desire.
    - I explain my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.

        principle: Reason in its practical use requires, as the ground of all merely contingent ends,
          an end of absolute worth.

    - Having no knowledge of such an end — cognizant of nothing that would qualify, no X —
      I am rationally bound to go in search of that knowledge.  I must take W as my end.
        : cf. `^^- Therefore.+bound to.+a best effort at learning what those norms are` @
          moral_uncertainty.brec : Another instance of a binding default norm
          triggered by one’s awareness of normative ignorance.
        : cf. `I must take M as my end\.$` @ moral_uncertainty.brec :
          How W relates to M is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.
        + Clarify that mere belief based on plausibility will not suffice here, as it would in the case
          of deliberating over means whose choice was open to prudence.  One must be certain of the end
          that serves as ground.
    - So it is a failure of reason that brings on my desire for a sense of purpose, a failure
      owing to the fault of having no X as an end, which in turn I can redress only through W.
    - W is knowledge of what is commonly called ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in desiring it, and frequently it is a byword
          for the unknowable, the unattainable.

        - Many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.

            + Ensure that ‘Many years ago’ and ‘only now… seeing a way toward it’ above are reconciled,
              it being ‘only now’ that I take the existential convenant to be underwriting a search.

    + Clarify: X is merely abstract.
    + Claim that nevertheless, I can obtain some knowledge of it.
        / Both analytic and synthetic.
    - Necessarily the attainment of X lies in the future.
        - Reason cannot (contrary to reason) demand an end that already is attained.
    - It follows that never can X be fully attained, or always the attainment of another X awaits.

      to pursue.
