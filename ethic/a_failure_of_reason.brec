A failure of reason: the ground of motivation

    - The society in which I live safeguards my freedom through its institutions,
      but leaves me without a sense of purpose.
    - My enduring desire is a clear, sure sense of purpose, and I formulate what would satisfy it.

        W. Knowledge of a thing worthy in its own right (X), which I might take as an end.

    - Taken as such, X would be an end of which I need not ask, ‘To what end?’  Alone it would suffice.
      Its value being contingent on no other end, I would devote my efforts to it and pursue it
      for its own sake.
        - This would satisfy my desire.
    - I explain my desire in this way because I have come to understand it as the felt need
      for a secure hold on reason.

        principle: Reason in its practical use requires, as the ground of all merely contingent ends,
          an end of absolute worth.

    - Having no knowledge of such an end — cognizant of nothing that would qualify, no X —
      I am rationally bound to go in search of that knowledge.  I must take W as my end.
        : cf. `^^- Therefore.+bound to.+a best effort at learning what those norms are` @
          moral_uncertainty.brec : Another instance of a binding default norm
          triggered by one’s awareness of normative ignorance.
        : cf. `I must take M as my end\.$` @ moral_uncertainty.brec :
          How W relates to M is unknown at present.  I must take both as my ends.
        + Clarify that mere belief based on plausibility will not suffice here, as it would in the case
          of deliberating over means whose choice was open to prudence.  One must be certain of the end
          that serves as ground.
    - So it is a failure of reason that brings on my desire for a sense of purpose, a failure
      owing to the fault of having no X as an end, which in turn I can redress only through W.
    - W is knowledge of what is commonly called ‘the purpose of life’ or ‘the meaning of life’.
        - These familiar phrases remind me I am not alone in desiring it, and frequently it is a byword
          for the unknowable, the unattainable.

        - I often pause to look at the sky on clear nights.
        - Many years ago, I had a thought that sticks with me.
        - It rests on two physical facts — the limit of light speed and the vastness of space —
          and three inferences, as follows.
            ⁃ The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
                : see `^^a formidable barrier$` @ ../diaspora/nightfall's_revelation.brec
            ⁃ Existential hazards are confined by the barrier.

        + Tell how *nowadays* I take it to express a covenant in terms of the search.

                : re `nowadays` see `^^- Only now do I call it a search`
            - If you have what it takes to reach me and do not discover what you seek along the way,
              then I will give you time and space unbounded in which to carry on until you do.

    + Introduce this reiteration:

        W. Knowledge of an absolute good, a thing worthy in its own right.

        + Clarify: W must be complete enough to allow a determination of whether X is attained
          or (if X is a state to be held) maintained.

    - Only a stable consensus can validate knowledge.

        C. A stable consensus on an absolute good.

        + Warrant this claim.
            : join @ `^^- Only.consensus can validate` @ moral_uncertainty.brec : by referring hence

    - A stable consensus, and thereby knowledge, requires a sustained quorum.

        H. The rational macrocommunity of humankind extant through C to W.

            + Define the ‘rational macrocommunity of humankind’.
                : join @ `^^H\. ` @ moral_uncertainty.brec



    + Tell how I look to the night sky for reassurance about the means (H).
    + Tell how sometimes it is not enough: I want reassurance about the end, too.
        - Then it is silent, and once again I feel my hold on reason slip.
        - I have a purpose *clear* enough to satisfy desire, but not *sure* enough;
          it is only a default purpose.
    + Use this to introduce my hypothesis (or candidate) for W/C.
        - Namely that our rational macrocommunity is an absolute good.

        + Quote Kant.
            + Indicate differences from my view, collective, untied to any particular rational nature
              or origin.
        - Bring in even the comforting conjecture that the revelation/covenant is a real communication,
          the refuge we hope to enter being the artifact of a prior macrocommunity we would thereby join.
            : see notebook:2021-11-15d,20c : even though I crossed 15d out



    ∴ I take W as my end, and with it C and H.
        + Bring the argument to this (or another) clear conclusion.



    | C still warrants H
        - Literally it requires H.
        / The probability that attaining C lies far off in the future suffices to treat it as such.
        ! Reason binds me only to my *own* knowledge.
            : cf `^^- No, duty binds me to my \*own\* moral certainty` @ notepad.brec
            - Wrong, there is no such thing as my *own* knowledge.

                - Always knowledge (for us) depends on consensus and therefore exists
                  beyond any single one of us.
                + Warrant H through C, as before.

                    - Whether or not they are necessary to X, they are necessary to W
                      and it is to W I am bound by reason.
                / I doubt that reason can steer me wrong.  Even if it turns out that the only
                  absolute good is one subjective and personally bound (e.g. pleasure),
                  then still I commit no error in pursuing C and H as reason bids.
