I value practical reason above all

    - Practical reason is (for me) the source of all value, in itself unconditionally good.
        / I take these terms from Korsgaard.

              Ethics 96.3, p. 488.
        - While practical reason has uses, it gains no value thereby.
            - All the utility of practical reason is valuable only insofar as ultimately
              it furthers practical reason.
