Nightfallâ€™s revelation

    - From the view on a clear night, and our knowledge of phyics,
      we can infer that a boundless, existential refuge lies open to us.

    a formidable barrier
        - The limit of light speed turns distance into a formidable barrier.
        + Quote Einsteinâ€™s 1905 paper.
            : e.g. http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ :
              For velocities greater than that of light our deliberations become meaningless
              â€¦ [it] plays the part, physically, of an infinitely great velocity. â€¦
              Velocities greater than that of light haveâ€¦ no possibility of existence.
    hazards are confined by the barrier
        - Ultimately the barrier is impassable to existential hazards.
        - All are confined to finite volumes of space.
    we are not confined
        - The barrier is not impassable to us.
        - This gives us reason to believe that, by way of an ever expanding dispersal,
          we can escape all existential hazards.
            / Those hazards are confined, but we are not.
