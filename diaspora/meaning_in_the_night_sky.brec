    a formidable barrier
        - The limit of light speed makes great distances a formidable barrier.
    hazards are confined by the barrier
        - Ultimately the barrier is impassable to existential hazards.
        - All are confined to finite volumes of space.
    we are not confined
        - The barrier is not impassable to us.
        - By way of an ever expanding dispersal, we can escape all existential hazards.
