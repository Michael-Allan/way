    [↑ Summarize in a paragraph what follows.

    [what is at stake]
        [↑ State what is at stake.
            - Address it at the level most appealing to technicians in general,
              abstracting away other levels by mere reference.
    [how to secure it]
        [↑ Put the entry steps that a technician-reader may follow in order to secure what is at stake.
            - Give the technician-reader to understand:
                ⁃ You may climb into the system yourself
                ⁃ It is immediately usable for purpose
                ⁃ Using it will bootstrap/snowball its further development,
                  such that eventually it becomes usable by non-technicians
            - Explicitly allow for disagreement with the present approach (theory or design),
              giving alternative steps to follow.
