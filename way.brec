    - Our reasons to support goal orientation are as numerous as our goals.
        - My own ultimate goal might not resonate with many.

        - But my personal goal, which I hope to achieve in my own lifetime, should â€¦
            \ So generalize my waycast, and keep to what will resonate
            \ with the technicians whom, above all, I need to engage.
    - I believe there exists in society widespread, unmet demand for goal orientation,
      such that if the supports are [at least] usable, then â€¦

        - Usablility is an impediment at present.
        - But demand may be such that we can target just technically oriented users at first, for whom
          usability is *less* of an impediment, and so bootstrap a working facility almost from scratch.
    dead rhetoric!!+ as it stands
        - I like this mode of introduction, but alone it works only for a patient reader.
        1+ Refocus on the whole file, the whole plan of action.
            : re `whole plan of action` see `^^steps to success`
        2+ There reward the readerâ€™s glance immediately, relying on prominent text alone,
           e.g. headings and opening sentences.
            a)+ Summarize what follows with an opening sentence and (maybe) paragraph of elaboration.
            b)+ State the problem, making clear what is at stake.
            c)+ Claim a systematic solution.
            d)+ Claim and give evidence of features attractive to a technician, such as:
                    â€¢ You can climb into the system, using it yourself
                    â€¢ It is usable almost from scratch
                    â€¢ Using it will bootstrap/snowball the development of it
                !! This is understated as mere â€˜featuresâ€™.
                    - Rather it is the crucial step to success.

        3+ Fit the introduction (or what I like of it) into this larger context.


    steps to success, whereby the waycast through its compiled way model (demonstration)
      does its own technical recruiting for the most part, and so proves itâ€™s own design
        1. State the purpose of the wayic system.
        2. State the main functions and the reason for each.
            : privately cf. ~/work/waycast/._/README_techno-didactic.html
        3. Implement them.
        4. Demonstrate them.
        5. Show a path from demonstration to adoption by developers and other core users,
          thence to widespread adoption.
