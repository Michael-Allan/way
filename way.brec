To aim for what matters

    - ‚Ä¶ ability to aim for what matters ‚Ä¶ enabling|facilitating it ‚Ä¶
    [‚Üë Summarize in a paragraph what follows.

    [what is at stake]
        - How many of our daily actions are directed to what matters,
          to that which ultimately gives meaning, purpose to our actions?
        - For most of us, very few.
            - Most of us even have difficulty putting your finger on just what it is that matters.
        - But suppose it was easy to:
            ‚Ä¢
            ‚Ä¢ [list of relevant wayic functions]
            ‚Ä¢
        - Then you could ‚Ä¶ [spelling out the aiming process in quotidian terms]
        [‚Üë State what is at stake.
            - Address it at the level most appealing to technicians in general,
              abstracting away other levels by mere reference.
    [how to secure it]
        [‚Üë Put the entry steps that a technician-reader may follow in order to secure what is at stake.
            - Give the technician-reader to understand:
                ‚ÅÉ You may climb into the system yourself
                ‚ÅÉ It is immediately usable for purpose
                ‚ÅÉ Using it will bootstrap/snowball its further development,
                  such that eventually it becomes usable by non-technicians
            - Explicitly allow for disagreement with the present approach (theory or design),
              giving alternative steps to follow.
