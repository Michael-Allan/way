Purpose of the wayic

    - To rightfully bring into society a system to form and further aimed ways of life,
      whereby the system, tapping into widespread, unmet demand for goal orientation,
      extends and maintains itself throughout society. \ Sync â†’ `../way.brec`.
        : re `widespread, unmet demand for goal orientation` see head @ premise.brec
        - To further an aimed way of life (once formed) is to advance it by execution
          and/or reformative development.
