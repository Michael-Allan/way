        G. Orients the user to an endmost personal goal.
            : e.g. @ `^^ Waycast` @ architecture.brec
            ∵ G inheres in P.
                ∵ P concerns the formation of aimed ways of life.
                ∵ Intrinsic to an aimed way of life is a personal goal, especially a final
                  or endmost goal.
                ∵ Intrinsic to an aimed way of life is an orientation to the goal.
                    ∵ Intrinsic to an aimed way of life is a choice of means in respect of the goal.
        Gi. Affords the user formation of an aimed way of life.
            : e.g. @ `^^ Intercast networking` @ architecture.brec
            ∵ Gi inheres in P.

        Rf. Hinders no rightful personal freedom.

            ∵ No right is infringed.
                : see `^^R$`
            ∵ To hinder a rightful personal freedom would infringe a right to F.
        Rg. Respects all rightful orientation to endmost goals.
            : e.g. @ `^^ Wayic Code` @ architecture.brec
            ∵ No right is infringed.

    • Omitting Fa or Fi would risk infringing a right.
        ∵ Omitting Fa or Fi would allow the development of a personal service monopoly.
            ∵ The wayic provides a personal service.
                ∵ G.
                ∵ Gi.
            ∵ The wayic is socially extended.
                ∵ X.
            ∵ Any socially extended personal service is liable to network effects
              that tilt the competitive landscape and risk tipping it into a monopoly.
            ∵ Under the pressure of network effects,
              only Fa and Fi together can hold a competitive landscape level.
        ∵ A personal service monopoly would likely contravene a right to F.
            ∵ Any F rightful, independent attempt to correct the service supply
              would likely be impeded by the monopoly.
                ∵ Monopolies tend to impede independent attempts at supply correction.
            ∵ Some such F rightful, independent attempts would be likely.
                ∵ Some F *form* independent attempts would be likely.
                    ∵ All service supplies have faults.
                    ∵ Faults in the supply of personal services tend to restrict
                      personal freedom.
                        ∵ Supply faults tend to restrict utility and use of a service.
                        ∵ To restrict utility or use of a personal service
                          is to restrict personal freedom.
                    ∵ Correction of such restrictive faults would be in demand.
                        ∵ People tend to oppose restrictions on their personal freedom.
                    ∵ Any such correction would inherently be F form.
                ∵ Some of these F-form attempts would likely be F rightful.
                    ∵ Not all F-form attempts would likely be wrong.
                    ∵ Not being wrong, an F-form attempt is thereby F rightful.


    R. Infringes no right.
        ∵ P asserts rightful action, which implies R.
