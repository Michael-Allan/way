        Ue. Attractive to engineers. \ A case of personal utility U.
            ∵ X is missing.
                : see `^^X\.` @ `^^ Missing structure$`
            ∵ X is necessary to the purpose.
                : join `^^X\.` @ architectonic.brec
            ∵ Ue ensures X.
                ∵ The wayic will extend itself throughout society if it involves and engages engineers.
                    ∵ Engineers will build it and use it.
                    ∵ Engineers are a part of society throughout.
            ∵ H is missing.
                : see `^^H\.` @ `^^ Missing structure$`
            ∵ H is necessary to the purpose.
                : join `^^H\.` @ architectonic.brec
            ∵ Ue ensures H.
                ∵ The wayic will maintain itself in society if it involves and engages engineers.
                    ∵ Engineers will use it and maintain it.
                    ∵ Engineers will remain a part of society.
        Fx. Easily available to non-users.
            ∵ Easy availability is a practical condition of Ue.  Ue would be infeasible without it.
                - The engineer wants to get his hands on the thing being built.
                - He wants to appraise its form, improve its function and gain immediate feedback
                  on the results.
        Go. Affording declaration by the user of the user’s aimed way of life.
            ∵ Way publication is a condition of Fx.
                ∵ Not seeing what others do with the wayic would hinder its adoption by non-users.
                    ∵ Copying is the most efficient means of adopting a practice.
            ∵ Nominate way publication is an affordance of G.
                ∵ A way published *nominately* attaches a personal name to the published way
                  and thereby to the endmost goal of the person.
            ∵ Way declaration entails nominate way publication.
