        U. Personally useful.
            ∵ U inheres in P.


        G. Relating the personal to the endmost goal of the person.
            ∵ G inheres in P.
                ∵ Essential to P is the concept of a personal service relating to one’s aimed way
                  of life.
                ∵ Essential to one’s aimed way of life is a goal, especially a final or endmost goal.

        Gi. Affording formation by the user of the user’s aimed way of life.

            - Operational data are visible to any crucial function of an altered copy
              that depends on them.

        R. Infringing no right.

    • Omitting Fa or Fi would risk infringing a right.
        ∵ Omitting Fa or Fi would allow the development of a personal service monopoly.
            ∵ The wayic provides a personal service.
                ∵ U.
            ∵ The wayic is socially extended.
                ∵ X.
            ∵ Any socially extended personal service is liable to network effects
              that tilt the competitive landscape and risk tipping it into a monopoly.
            ∵ Under the pressure of network effects,
              only Fa and Fi together can hold a competitive landscape level.
        ∵ A personal service monopoly would likely contravene a right to F.
            ∵ Any F rightful, independent attempt to correct the service supply
              would likely be impeded by the monopoly.
                ∵ Monopolies tend to impede independent attempts at supply correction.
            ∵ Some such F rightful, independent attempts would be likely.
                ∵ Some F *form* independent attempts would be likely.
                    ∵ All service supplies have faults.
                    ∵ Faults in the supply of personal services tend to restrict
                      personal freedom.
                        ∵ Supply faults tend to restrict utility and use of a service.
                        ∵ To restrict utility or use of a personal service
                          is to restrict personal freedom.
                    ∵ Correction of such restrictive faults would be in high demand.
                        ∵ People tend to oppose restrictions on their personal freedom.
                    ∵ Any such correction would inherently be F form.
                ∵ Some of these F form attempts would likely be F rightful.
                    ∵ Not all F form attempts would likely be wrong.
                    ∵ Not being wrong, an F form attempt is thereby F rightful.
